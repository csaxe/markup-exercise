This is essentially an offering card from homedepot.com. I chose this because I wanted us to think about how this can be marked up outside the context (and preconcieved notions) of our own application.

## Considerations
- How does the outline differ from the _presented_ order of the elements?
- Think ahead - whenever possible, the CSS should be applied (later) to achieve the desired appearance
- Are there any accessibility concerns we can mitigate just by using well-formed markup?
