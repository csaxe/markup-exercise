# Article
This is a fairly straightforward article from the NYT.  I've chosen this as our collaborative exercise specifically because it demonstrates semantic concerns in a straightforward way, so should be a good conversation document.

Keep in mind that this is an article, and likely use some elements that we may not need in application development.  It also has a much clearer outline than an application usually will.

## Considerations:
- Beyond title and content, what are the other components of this document
- How do the metadata fit into the outline?
- How can we address the image semantically?
