# Front End Guild - Markup Exercise
An exercise to practice semantic markup of real-world examples

Markup is at the heart of every web application, but is frequently an afterthought.  A quick survey of many applications, including our own, reveals a "div soup" that does not convey any meaning about the content it contains.  Today's exercise is a chance for us to talk about markup and start to come to some common approaches to writing better markup in the future.

We'll work in two parts - a live code discussion/collaboration, and (time permitting) individual work.  For both sections, we'll use the files in the `templates` folder as starting points for our work.

## Part one: live code example
We'll start by collaboratively live coding a simple article example.  I've pulled a screenshot of an article from the New York Times.  I'll share my screen and code it up with input from the group:

1. Outline the article and identify the high-level semantic structure.
2. Flesh out the details using semantic HTML tags

## Part two: Free code your own examples
For this part, I'd like anyone interested to open a branch on the repo and address one or both of the other examples.  Please create a new folder in the example you're working on so that we can compare work later if desired.  When you're ready, open a PR and we can collectively give feedback and (I hope) learn from each others' thinking.

Please create two files, as we will in the collaborative example; one containing an outline and the other containing the markup.

## Resources
[MDN: HTML elements reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element): This document does a good job of grouping the available elements by function and giving a summary of their purpose and meaning.

There are other resources available, but I'm keeping this list short for simplicity's sake.  If there are other resources the group would like to add, I can include them here.
