# Layout
For this exercise, I'd like us to consider how we can construct a layout that still provides some level of semantics.  I've blurred most of the things within this screen capture.  Instead, focus on the high level structures, the source order, and using appropriate tags to provide semantic hinting at what the high level structures contain.

## Considerations:
- what is the correct source order?
- What is the HTML `title` of this page?
- How can you best mark up the name of the company?
